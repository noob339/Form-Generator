# HonorsProject1

This project allows us to automatically generate a form from a file, and in this case I am using a txt file.

The file is then converted into a string and then parsed into an html file.

Based on the template from the txt file, the user is able to create a multiple choice form, a written answer form, a mixed form, and hopefully other varieties of forms moving forward. 

The following is the template used:

title:

      question:SA/MP
      prompt: 
      answer:
      @answer:


The template above represents just one question but with a title.

title: - This tag is used for the title alone, and the progrem expects just one title.

question:MP - There can be an unlimited amount of questions and the "MP" tag and "SA" tags are used to denote the format of the question.
MP is multiple choice and SA is short answer.

prompt: - Each question has a prompt and the prompt could be an acutal question or it could be some form of instruction to the user.

answer: - There could be multiple answers depending on the format of the quiz, for example true or false has 2 possible answers, a written response typically has one and a proper multiple choice question has four.

@ - This symbol is used to denote the correct answer for the multiple choice question


Below is an Example of the program

While the css is not being generated, the HTML is and that will be part of the next step, generating the CSS page and abstracting the template for users to builder their forms online.
